Enum:
	- It is user-defined data type with a fixed set of possible values.

Struct:
	- It is user-defined type in C#, which holds a set of variables.
	- It is a light weight class with limited functionalities 
	- A struct can't declare a default constructor, Done by CLR
	- struct can't inherit another struct or class
	- it implement interface

Composition:
	- It is design principle where a class is composed of one or more objects, rather than inherting from another class.
	- It promotes the idea of "has-a" relationship rather than "is-a" relationships.


** Use inheritance when there is a clear hierarchical relationship and shared behavior
** Use interfaces to define common capabilities and promote polymorphism
** Use composition to create flexible and reusable design by combinig objects

- Take example of Flyable class -> with Fly() which inherited from Duck, Eagale Classes --- Inheritance
- Now class Plane, which need Fly() method, rather inheriting, will cretae object Flyable and use Fly() --- Composition

** when its a [is-a] relation go for Inheritance
** when its a [has-a] raltion go for Composition

Dependency Injection (DI):
	- Its a design pattern that allows classes to receive thier dependencise(injected) rather than creating them.
	- Promotes decoulping, improves testability

	Types of DI:
		1. constructor injection: 
			- dependencies are passed to a class through constructor.
			- this ensures class has all required dependencies to function correctly from the moment of instantiation
			
				private readonly IEmailService _emailService;
				// Constructor injection
				public NotificationService(IEmailService emailService)
				{
				_emailService = emailService;
				}

		2. property injection: 
			- dependencies are set through public properties of class.
			- allows optional dependencies and supports lazy initialization

				// Property to inject the email service
				public IEmailService EmailService { get; set; }

		3. method injection
			- dependencies are passed to a method when it is called.
			- useful when menthod requires certain dependencies foe specific operation

				// Method that requires the email service dependency to be passed
				public void SendNotification(IEmailService emailService, string recipient, string message)
				{
					// Logic to process and send notifications
					emailService.SendEmail(recipient, "Notification", message);
				}

Inversion of Control (IOC):
	- its a design pattern that emphasizes decoupling and shifting control of object creation from class to external entiry, typically IoC container.
	- so classes become more modular, as they don't need to know how to crate their dependencies


Delegates:
	- Type safe function pointers that allow methods to be passed as parameters

	syntax:
		public delegate ReturnType DelegateName(ParameterType1 parameter1, ParameterType2 parameter2, ...);

	// Define a delegate for logging
	public delegate void LogHandler(string message);


Events:
	- Bult on delegates, allowing a class to notify another classes when somthing happens

Real-world Example: 
	- Logging system using events to notify different logging mechanisms (console, file, remote server).
